# Hi, my name is Ben Berg.
I'm an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Before that I was a Ph.D. Student at Carnegie Mellon University where I was advised by Mor Harchol-Balter.\

Here are links to online copies of my [publications](/publications/) as well as my [CV](/CV.pdf).

In general, I am interested in using performance modeling to make better resource allocation decisions in computer systems.
I mainly focus on [scheduling parallelizable jobs](/parallel/), where one must decide how to allocate cores or servers among parallelizable jobs.
I also work on [caching](/caching/), where one must decide how to best allocate cache space when admitting or evicting objects.

Here's a video that gives a brief synopsis of my research and future plans:
