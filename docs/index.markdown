# Hi, my name is Ben Berg.
I'm a sixth year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm advised by Mor Harchol-Balter.\
I was a recipient of the [Facebook Graduate Fellowship](https://research.fb.com/fellows/berg-benjamin/).\
\
Here are links to online copies of my [publications](/publications/) as well as my [CV](/CV.pdf).

In general, I am interested in using performance modeling to make better resource allocation decisions in computer systems.
I mainly focus on [scheduling parallelizable jobs](/parallel/), where one must decide how to allocate cores or servers among parallelizable jobs.
I also work on [caching](/caching/), where one must decide how to best allocate cache space when admitting or evicting objects.
